# Idea

I use blender alot to make 3d models and animations. There also happen to be alot of keybinds and shortcuts in blender. This gave me the idea to create a macropad to make my blender workflow faster so now this is one of my projects. How i think ill go about this project is that first i'll use blender to create a 3d model of what i want the macropad to look like. Then after i do that i design the circuitry and design a pcb. After that i get the pcb and program it, and finally i 3d print a case and put it all together.

# Step One - modeling the macropad

My original inspiration for the macropad came from the elgato stream deck+, which has a combination of dials,buttons and screens. So for my macropad i wanted a similar style. Another thing i wanted was to have it be a similar size to my keyboard so that it looks like a dashboard.
